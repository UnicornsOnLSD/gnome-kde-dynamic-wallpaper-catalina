This fork uses the original images from macOS instead of the modified ones from the original.

Unlike the original, this only works on KDE since I have no idea how the Gnome system works.

# Installation (Arch/Manjaro)

3. Right click on your desktop and click "Configure Desktop..."
4. Set the wallpaper type to dynamic
5. Click on "Add Wallpaper..."
6. Select wallpaper.heic (or whatever you called it)
