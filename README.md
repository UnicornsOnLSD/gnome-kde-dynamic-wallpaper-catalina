This fork uses the original images from macOS instead of the modified ones from the original.

Unlike the original, this only works on KDE since I have no idea how the Gnome system works.

# Installation (Arch/Manjaro)

1. Install plasma5-wallpapers-dynamic (`yay -S plasma5-wallpapers-dynamic`)
2. Download wallpaper.heic (feel free to rename it) and place it somewhere
3. Right click on your desktop and click "Configure Desktop..."
4. Set the wallpaper type to dynamic
5. Click on "Add Wallpaper..."
6. Select wallpaper.heic (or whatever you called it)

(btw I'm keeping the old catalina-solar.json because if I ever bother to add a solar config, I'll probably want to use it as a baseline)
